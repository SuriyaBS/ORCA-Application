# A new Flutter project.

App is a software tool designed for companies that need to store and manage their coding resources. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface that allows the company to organize its resources in a pictorial form, making it easy for users to quickly find the resources they need.

The app is designed to store coding resources, which can include code snippets, libraries, frameworks, and other software components that are used by the company. These resources are stored in a central repository, which is accessible to authenticated users within the company.

The app provides a pictorial representation of the coding resources, which can help users quickly identify and find the resources they need. The pictorial representation can be customized to meet the specific needs of the company, allowing for the creation of custom categories, tags, and other organizational features.

Authenticated users within the company can make changes to the coding resources, including adding new resources, modifying existing resources, or deleting resources that are no longer needed. The app is designed to allow for version control, so that changes can be tracked and managed over time.

Once changes have been made to the coding resources, they can be saved in another repository. This can be done either within the company's network or on an external server, depending on the company's needs. The app provides a simple, intuitive interface for saving resources to another repository, making it easy for users to manage their coding resources effectively.

The app is designed with security in mind, ensuring that only authenticated users with the necessary permissions can access the coding resources. This helps to protect the company's intellectual property and ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the resources.

Overall, the app provides a powerful tool for managing coding resources, making it easy for companies to store, organize, and manage their resources in a pictorial form. With its intuitive interface, version control, and security features, the app helps companies streamline their development processes and improve collaboration between team members.
